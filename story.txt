My name is Yijun Cheng, this is my story. I am writing this story for xteam3 assignment. It is difficult! I am having trouble thinking of topics to write about so I'm not sure where to start. We can talk about sports, classes, hobbies, or something else.

Hello Bros! This is Shlok! I hate GitHub

This assignment is difficult, I agree! I like sports too! My favorite team is the Chicago Cubs. It's sad that their year ended before the playoffs. Their story ended, and now mine is too.
